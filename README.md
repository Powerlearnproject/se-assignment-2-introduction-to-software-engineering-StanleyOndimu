# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:

## Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
-Software engineering involves application of engineering principles in the design, development, testing, deployment and maintanance of software whereas programming focuses on writing, testing and updating code.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1. Requirements: Involves assessing the user needs and the system requirements that would be needed to fulfill the user needs.
2. Design: Involves creating the designs for the software architecture and the user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Making sure that the software meets quality standards and specified functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to the users.
6. Maintanance: Providing updates to the software after its release.

## Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
-Agile model is used in long-term projects while waterfall is preferred for short-term projects.
-Agile model is focused on flexibility, collaboration and constant feedback while waterfall model takes a linear and sequential approach.
-Agile method makes it easy to accomodate changes while waterfall method is difficult to incorporate changes.
-Agile method is not predictable compared to waterfall method which is more predictable.

## Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
-Requirements engineering involves development and verification of requirements to ensure they meet the user needs. This involves understanding the stakeholder's desires and specifying and managing requirements to minimize the risk of delivering a system that doesn't meet the stakeholders' desires.
-Requirements engineering involves the following activities:

1. Elicitation: Involves engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs and requirements.
2. Documentation: Involves capturing the requirements in a documented format for referrence by both stakeholders and the technical team.
3. Validation and negotiation: Involves ensuring the documented requirements are agreed by all stakeholders involved.
4. Management: Involves accomodation of any changes that might arise in relation to the requirements.

## Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
-Modularity refers to the extent to which a software can be divided into smaller modules.
-Modularity enhances design clarity which allows for ease of implementation, debugging, testing, documentation, maintanance and scalability of the software. This is achieved through:

1. Distinct functionality which clearly defines the function of each module.
2. Identification of dependencies allow for ease of understanding which modules are dependent on the other to achieve their functions.
3. Allows for reusability of modules which makes the process of software maintanance and scalability easier and less resource intensive.

## Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Testing is important in ensuring that the software works as intended and also meets the stakeholders' requirements.
-The different levels of software testing are as follows:

1. Unit testing: Involves testing individual modules/components.
2. Integration testing: Tests the interactions between different modules and components.
3. System testing: Tests the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing: Ensuring that the software meets and satisfies the user needs and requirements.

## Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
-Version control system is a system that allows for collaboration, revision and tracking of changes to a project. Examples of VCSs include git, mercurial and bitKeeper.
-VCSs are important for the following reasons:

1. Allows for archiving of different versions of the project.
2. Enforces discipline by managing the process by which control of items is passed from one person to the next.
3. Maintains important historical information and essential details.
4. Enables easy collaboration within the members of the team.
5. Allows for easy correction of mistakes and accidental deletions.

## Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
-Project manager oversees the whole process of software development including planning, execution and delivery.
-Key responsibilities of a software project manager include:

1. Leading and coordinating the project team.
2. Identifying, analyzing and mitigating potential risks.
3. Regularly updating stakeholders on the progress of the project.
4. Monitoring project progress against the schedule.

-Challenges faced in managing software projects include:

1. Changing requirements can be hard to keep track of and plan for.
2. Tight deadlines can be hard to fulfill.
3. Balancing the stakeholders' needs and expectations with what can be achieved can be challenging.
4. Managing team members with different skills and personalities can be challenging.
5. Keeping up with and integrating evolving technologies can be difficult.

## Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
-Software maintanance refers to the continued support and regular updates of a software after it has been deployed to ensure that it continues to work as intended.
-Types of maintenance activities include:

1. Corrective maintenance: Involves responding to bug reports and fixing faulty code.
2. Perfective maintenance: Involves accomodating new features and improvements to the code for better efficiency.
3. Adaptive maintenance: Carried out in response to environment changes such as a new operating system.

## Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
-Software engineers can face the following ethical issues:

1. Misuse of software for harmful purposes such as surveillance.
2. Considering the broader social implications of software.
3. Transparency about the software's limitations and potential risks.
4. Navigating intellectual property such as copyright, patents and trademarks.
5. Potential for bias and unfairness in areas such as algorithms.

-How to adhere to ethical standards:

1. Limiting the potential of software being used for things like surveillance.
2. Encouraging the development of socially positive software.
3. Promoting transparecy about the limitations and potential risks of software.
4. Respecting intellectual property and using the right channels to acquire and utilize intellectual property.
5. Unbiased approach to development that ensure fair service to all users.
